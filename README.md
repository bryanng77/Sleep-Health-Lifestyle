# Project Background
Maintaining a balance between health, lifestyle, and sleep quality is crucial in today's fast-paced world. Sleep is a vital component of overall health, influencing physical and mental well-being. With increasing interest in understanding how lifestyle choices impact health outcomes, the ability to draw insights from sleep and health data has become essential for both individuals and organizations.

This project aims to analyze a dataset that captures various aspects of individualsâ€™ sleep patterns, lifestyle factors, and health indicators. The dataset includes age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity, stress levels, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and any diagnosed sleep disorders.

Insights and Recommendations are provided in the following areas:

1. **Sleep Quality and Physical Activity**
2. **Stress Levels and Sleep Duration**
3. **Sleep Disorders and Health Indicators**
4. **Sleep Patterns Across Different Age Groups**
5. **Gender Differences in Sleep Patterns**
6. **Sleep and BMI Category**
7. **Occupational Analysis**
8. **Steps to Improve Sleep Quality**
