# PROJECT BACKGROUND
In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining a balance between health, lifestyle, and sleep quality is crucial. Sleep is a vital component of overall health, influencing both physical and mental well-being. With increasing interest in understanding how lifestyle choices impact health outcomes, the ability to draw insights from sleep and health data has become essential for both individuals and organizations.

This project aims to analyze a dataset that captures various aspects of individuals’ sleep patterns, lifestyle factors, and health indicators. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity, stress levels, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and any diagnosed sleep disorders.
